Assignment 1 (Process Management):
Maintain Efficient Process Utilization on Windows

Eg: Kill a running task (say Notepad) using powershell

Take the PID (Process ID) from task manager (ctrl+shift+esc)

Run the command in powershell:
taskkill /pid <enter id here>
If success the following message will be printed:  SUCCESS: Sent termination signal to terminate the process with PID <id>.
  
Hence, the process will be eliminated.
  
For multiple process termination use:
taskkill /pid <enter id here> /pid <enter another id> ....
  
All the processes will be simultaneously terminated successfully.
